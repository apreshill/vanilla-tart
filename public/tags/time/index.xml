      <description>Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.
Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius â€“ set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands.
Make yourself believe the truth of my words, that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach.</description>
