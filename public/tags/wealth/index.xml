      <description>Judging by what you write me, and by what I hear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future.
You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit.

Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady.</description>
