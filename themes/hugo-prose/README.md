# HUGO PROSE

## _It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more_

**Hugo Prose** is a theme derived from the [hugo-xmin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), and inspired by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com) (previously known as the Academic theme), [Distill](https://distill.pub), and [tufte.css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte.css). See https://prose.yihui.org for a live demo.

Please note that this project is still work-in-progress.
